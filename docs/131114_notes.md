# 14-11-13 Skype Notes
The installation will be a Science Rave 'art installation' and created from sound clash from the 303 and 808. Sound can be one tune to create a general sound in the room. We can have one set to the left and one to the right, depending on the space we are given.

They can be placed on plinths, on top of the sound system on speakers or suspend them high with spotlights. Cables can be layer on the ground as a part of the 'art piece' and we might use art fences to emphasise that it is an art piece. Pete will send out his thoughts after we have received drawings of the space.

The budget is £2,000 (excl. VAT), and split for John £500; Arthur £500; H&L £500; equipment £500.

Pete will be chasing sound system from his friend Grant and talk to Steve from Warp about software.

Amalie will be following up on: 
- Floor plan
- Where will we be
- Existing plans for other artists in the space
- When we can get the 303 and 808 from Warp
- If we can get additional kit from Warp (sound system, if they have any thoughts about kit they want us to use, what else?)

And arrange a meeting for all os us.
